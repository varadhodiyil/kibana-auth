# need some extra directories in the zip to make the plugin loader happy.
# if we were using the plugin-helpers there is a task to zip it up.
# we don't want to use it because it's not published to npm and requires a full
# checkout and yarn bootstrap of kibana.

# required properties when building the zip
# 1. exclude files (we want to put the final build in a subfolder so we need to prevent recursion into it.)
# 2. the ability to set a prefix that includes the parent directories kibana/plugin-name, for example --transform in 'tar'.
# 3. must work on both windows/linux - ie, no symbolic links.

# here's what I've tried to make the zip structure work.
# 1. the zip utility is not able to prefix the root dir with kibana/kibana-mithril inside the zip.
# 2. the tar utility can prefix the root dir and exclude files, but not create ZIP files as required by kibana.
# 3. cp alone does not work as it has no support for excluding files
#	- we get a recursion error when copying a parent folder into a subdirectory
# 4. using symbolic links, this doesn't work in gitbash (at least not without black magic.)

# here's what we are doing instead: use 'find' to skip some folders to prevent recursion error when using cp
# use cp to copy all files into a subdirectory with the required folder structure. this is slow,
# because we need to copy node_modules.

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | xargs cp -u -v -t $plugin_root

# Not sure what the point of these subdirectories are, they make the build process really awkward. If kibana needs them
# to identify a plugin zip, why can't they just read the "kibana" property from the package.json? why isn't the plugin
# helper available on npm? Checking out the whole kibana repo and making sure yarn bootstrap works is too much overhead.
